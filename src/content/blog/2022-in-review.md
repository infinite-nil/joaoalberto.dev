title: My 2022 in review?
date: 2021-12-24

Maybe this title is a bit bait, but to be honest, I don't remember too many details about what I achieved this year and this is the reason I am writing this post right now (The last day of the year, at 4am).

Don't get me wrong, my year was awesome and I couldn't be happier about my personal life, I have a beautiful family and lovely friends. The problem is that my professional life seems stagnant üòü.

### The real problem

From my point of view, the problem is that I do not track my progress in any aspect and I simply can't trust my brain to remember what I ate for breakfast, imagine for the whole year.

### The solution?

I've been thinking about this for a while, but I never really started.

Should I start [Journaling](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&ContentTypeID=1)? Should I write more in this blog (Probably yes)? Should I write more on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/infinite_nil)?

I think the answer is **yes** for all of them. I'm not saying I'll do this every day but I'll give my best to do at least one per day.

- Small blog posts describing something I created or learned.
- Tweet something helpful using the #TIL hashtag.
- Write to journal about how I'm feeling.

I hope that these ideas help me to track my progress during the next year.

### Finally, what I remember from 2022

- My English improved a lot. _Thanks to this I'm writing this right now_
- I learned [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)
- I learned **a lot** about [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
- I started my channel on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/joaoalbertodev)

A lot more happened, good and bad, but I really don't remember.

Thanks for reading. ‚úåÔ∏è
